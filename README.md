# ParanoidDrive
This is the old version I created before there was ever even a OneDrive library for Python. I made a really hacky version of a OneDrive python library in `ParanoidOneDrive.py` which only implemented the functions I needed, and badly. Now that there is a real OneDrive python library, I'm rewriting this to be better.
